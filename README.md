# Website resume project
 Here is the documentation and code of my resume website.
I decided that it was needed to make a website where I can show in a stylish and skillful way all the tools I can use and the experiences I have gathered in one place. That's why I decided to make a website for my resume.

Another thought that came to my mind is that I am a junior pentester enthousiast. Why not combine my coding skills with some CTF construction practice. So I decided to make my resume website into a CTF. There is a hidden secret only visible if you know how to scan, enumerate, exploit and extract information from a target.

Hope you will enjoy my website and if you try to hack it, have fun!
